# Magento Plugin (Two_Gateway)

Two's Magento 2 BNPL payment plugin. Brand-aware single-module
extension; brand-specific identity values resolve through
`Two\Gateway\Api\BrandRegistryInterface`. The default DI
binding in `etc/di.xml` resolves to
`Two\Gateway\Brand\DescriptorBackedBrandRegistry`.
Building a partner overlay or adding a brand-driven field:
see docs/brand-overlay-guide.md.

Standard Magento dev workflow: composer install, bin/magento
setup:di:compile, setup:upgrade, cache:flush. PHPUnit under Test/.

This is a **public repository**. Do not commit session-specific
content such as plans, transcripts, or implementation notes.

## Branching & releases

-   **PRs target `main`** (prod). `staging` is the GitHub default and the
    staging shop's deploy branch; `merge-back.yml` syncs `main → staging`
    after merges (ff-only, else a sync PR). Branch off `origin/main`.
    There is no `develop` branch.
-   **Releases are automated** — `release.yml` runs on CI success on
    `main`, derives the bump from conventional commits since the last
    bare-semver tag (`feat!:` → major, `feat:` → minor, else patch), tags,
    and creates the GitHub Release. Don't hand-run bumpver.
-   `bumpver.toml` `current_version` MUST equal the version strings in the
    files it patches (`composer.json` `"version"`, `etc/config.xml`
    `<version>`) or every release dies at the bump step with "No match for
    pattern". Both fields are functional (rendered by the adminhtml Version
    field) — keep them.
-   **Re-cutting an exact version after deleting its tag:** deleting the
    tag + Release is not enough — reset `current_version` to the highest
    surviving semver tag first, or the next release overshoots (prev-tag +
    accumulated commits can bump past the intended version). Deleting +
    recreating a tag that has a Release demotes it to a draft — repair with
    `gh release delete` + `gh release create --verify-tag`.
-   Packagist syncs off this repo's webhook. If a tag doesn't appear on
    Packagist, check `gh api repos/two-inc/magento-plugin/hooks`
    `last_response.code` — 403 means stale Packagist-side authorization for
    the package (fix on Packagist, not GitHub); redeliver the hook to
    confirm.

## Local-dev modules disabled by `make install`

`make install` disables PageBuilder and the Analytics module family
in the local Docker container so that `setup:di:compile` and the
storefront's RequireJS bootstrap stay fast. See README's
"Local-dev perf" section for the full list, the rationale, and the
re-enable recipe.

**If a future enquiry surfaces along the lines of "why isn't this
PageBuilder banner / promo block / CMS slide rendering in my local
build", the answer is almost certainly that `Magento_PageBuilder` is
disabled by `make install`** — point them at the README section,
which includes the commands to re-enable PageBuilder for testing
brand content that relies on it. Same applies to anything
analytics-driven (e.g. NewRelic dashboards, GA events).

## DI registration scope for Structure / Config Reader plugins

**Plugins that target `Magento\Config\Model\Config\Structure\Reader`
(or any class whose output gets cached under an area-specific cache
key like `adminhtml::backend_system_configuration_structure`) MUST
be registered in `etc/di.xml` (global), NOT `etc/adminhtml/di.xml`.**

Reason: CLI invocations of `bin/magento` (`config:set`,
`app:config:import`, `deploy:mode:set`, `admin:user:create`, etc.)
populate the adminhtml-scoped Structure cache but bootstrap with
the CLI process's DI graph — which loads `etc/di.xml` +
`etc/crontab/di.xml` and does **NOT** load `etc/adminhtml/di.xml`.
Plugins registered only under adminhtml therefore never fire for
CLI-driven cache writes; the cache lands incomplete, and subsequent
admin web requests read the broken cached Structure from
`Scoped::_loadScopedData`.

This is exactly how ABN-415 ("ABN admin tab vanishes after pod
restart") happened — `SynthesiseBrandAdminForm` was originally
registered under adminhtml; every CLI command in the init/setup
hooks repopulated the cache without invoking synthesis.

If your plugin's `afterRead` body only mutates the adminhtml shape,
firing in other areas is harmless (wasted parse on a payload no
consumer reads). The cost of registering globally is essentially
zero; the cost of getting this wrong is a recurring restart-time
production bug that masks itself behind cache-flush workarounds.

The inverse trap applies to `etc/crontab/di.xml`: a plugin registered
ONLY there fires in CLI processes (cron, indexer) but NOT in HTTP
requests. If you find yourself reaching for crontab-scope DI, ask
whether the symmetric case (HTTP request misses the plugin) would
break correctness — almost always yes; register globally instead.
