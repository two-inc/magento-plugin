# Magento Plugin (Two_Gateway)

Two's Magento 2 BNPL payment plugin. Brand-aware single-module
extension; brand-specific identity values resolve through
`Two\Gateway\Api\BrandRegistryInterface`. The default DI
binding in `etc/di.xml` resolves to
`Two\Gateway\Brand\DescriptorBackedBrandRegistry`.
Building a partner overlay or adding a brand-driven field:
see docs/brand-overlay-guide.md.

Standard Magento dev workflow: composer install, bin/magento
setup:di:compile, setup:upgrade, cache:flush. PHPUnit under Test/.

This is a **public repository**. Do not commit session-specific
content such as plans, transcripts, or implementation notes.

## Local-dev modules disabled by `make install`

`make install` disables PageBuilder and the Analytics module family
in the local Docker container so that `setup:di:compile` and the
storefront's RequireJS bootstrap stay fast. See README's
"Local-dev perf" section for the full list, the rationale, and the
re-enable recipe.

**If a future enquiry surfaces along the lines of "why isn't this
PageBuilder banner / promo block / CMS slide rendering in my local
build", the answer is almost certainly that `Magento_PageBuilder` is
disabled by `make install`** — point them at the README section,
which includes the commands to re-enable PageBuilder for testing
brand content that relies on it. Same applies to anything
analytics-driven (e.g. NewRelic dashboards, GA events).

## A surcharge cap of 0: refused at entry, relayed faithfully at runtime

Two rules that look contradictory and are not. Keep both.

**Runtime — never guard.** A configured surcharge limit of `0` that
somehow exists must be relayed to the pricing API as `cap => 0.0`.
Do not throw, do not omit the key, do not turn it into "no cap".
A zero cap bounds the buyer fee at zero — no surcharge is applied —
and only an *absent* (null) limit means "no cap", which omits the
`cap` key and applies the percentage uncapped. Absent and zero are
different values and both pass through faithfully.

TWO-25269 briefly added a guard that threw on a zero cap, on the
premise that a zero cap read as "no cap" downstream and would relay
an uncapped percentage. **That premise was false and the guard was
reverted** — a zero cap bounds the fee at zero, it never uncaps it.
In `fixed_and_percentage` mode the cap bounds the combined fee, so
`Limit = 0` suppresses the fixed component too, not just the
percentage part.
`Test/Unit/Service/Order/SurchargeCalculatorTest.php` pins this.

**Admin — refuse zero.** Separately, TWO-25289 stopped a zero limit
being *configurable*: `Model\Config\Backend\SurchargeGrid` rejects
`limit === 0` on save, and the grid refuses it in the browser too.
An EMPTY limit stays valid and still means "no limit".

This is not the reverted guard under another name. It is an
admin-boundary decision rather than a runtime one, and the reason is
different: a merchant who wants no fee on a term says so directly
with 0% and 0 fixed, so a zero limit has no legitimate use — while on
the sibling plugins a zero cap was being normalised to *absent* and
relayed genuinely uncapped, overcharging the buyer. Refusing it at
entry closes that consistently across all three plugins.

**Read path — junk is absent, zero is not.**
`Model\Config\Repository::getSurchargeConfig()` no longer casts the
stored limit blindly. The admin grid refuses junk, but the stored value
can still arrive from a hand-edited row, `config:set` or an import, and
a bare `(float)` cast turned `abc` into a hard cap of 0 (suppressing
the fee) and `-10` into a negative cap (refused upstream, so the buyer
sees a generic failure). Non-scalar, empty, non-numeric, non-finite and
negative all resolve to NULL — absent, i.e. no cap. A genuine `0` is
still relayed verbatim, because a zero cap clamps the fee to zero and
that is a different instruction from absence. Same shape as the sibling
plugins.

So: if you are asked to remove the admin validation, that is the
runtime rule being misread. If you are asked to make the runtime
throw on a zero cap, that is the reverted guard being reintroduced.
Neither follows from the other.

## Monetary values in the pricing request are rounded to 2dp

`SurchargeCalculator::convertAmount()` rounds `cap` and `surcharge` to
two decimal places before they go on the wire. The API refuses
anything finer rather than rounding it itself, so an unrounded FX
conversion used to be rejected upstream and surface to the buyer as a
generic "temporarily unavailable" error.

Plain half-up rounding, deliberately. Sub-cent caps, away-from-zero
rounding and zero-decimal currencies are all explicitly out of scope
(TWO-25289).

That is safe for anything a merchant can **configure**, because the
grid refuses any limit that rounds away at 2dp — not just an explicit
`0` but anything under half a cent. So the rounding direction never
decides whether a configured cap survives.

What it does **not** cover is an FX conversion landing under half a
cent: that collapses to `0.00` and suppresses the fee. Accepted, not
overlooked — pinned by
`testASubCentCapRoundsDownToZeroWhichIsAcceptedScope` so it reads as a
decision. Do not "fix" it with away-from-zero rounding without
reopening the scope question.

Also note the zero rule is **skipped, not applied and not deleted**, on
the Limit column when the surcharge type has no percentage component.
The grid JS hides that column, but a hidden input still posts, so a
limit stored under an earlier percentage type keeps arriving. Rejecting
a zero there would fail the whole section save over a cell the admin
can neither see nor clear, so the rule is skipped and the cell is
stored exactly as posted.

Do not "tidy" that into deleting the cell. Deleting discards a VALID
limit on any save made while the surcharge is fixed-only or off — a
normal round trip — while the equally inapplicable percentage cell
survives it; and at a non-default scope deleting an override does not
retire a value at all, it re-exposes the parent's. A legacy zero simply
surfaces again when the column comes back into view, which is where the
admin can act on it. The visibility flag is threaded from `afterSave()`
into `validateValue()` and pinned there by
`testProductionAfterSaveWiresTheLimitColumnVisibilityIntoTheZeroRule`.

## DI registration scope for Structure / Config Reader plugins

**Plugins that target `Magento\Config\Model\Config\Structure\Reader`
(or any class whose output gets cached under an area-specific cache
key like `adminhtml::backend_system_configuration_structure`) MUST
be registered in `etc/di.xml` (global), NOT `etc/adminhtml/di.xml`.**

Reason: CLI invocations of `bin/magento` (`config:set`,
`app:config:import`, `deploy:mode:set`, `admin:user:create`, etc.)
populate the adminhtml-scoped Structure cache but bootstrap with
the CLI process's DI graph — which loads `etc/di.xml` +
`etc/crontab/di.xml` and does **NOT** load `etc/adminhtml/di.xml`.
Plugins registered only under adminhtml therefore never fire for
CLI-driven cache writes; the cache lands incomplete, and subsequent
admin web requests read the broken cached Structure from
`Scoped::_loadScopedData`.

This is exactly how the admin-tab-vanishes-after-pod-restart bug
happened — `SynthesiseBrandAdminForm` was originally
registered under adminhtml; every CLI command in the init/setup
hooks repopulated the cache without invoking synthesis.

If your plugin's `afterRead` body only mutates the adminhtml shape,
firing in other areas is harmless (wasted parse on a payload no
consumer reads). The cost of registering globally is essentially
zero; the cost of getting this wrong is a recurring restart-time
production bug that masks itself behind cache-flush workarounds.

The inverse trap applies to `etc/crontab/di.xml`: a plugin registered
ONLY there fires in CLI processes (cron, indexer) but NOT in HTTP
requests. If you find yourself reaching for crontab-scope DI, ask
whether the symmetric case (HTTP request misses the plugin) would
break correctness — almost always yes; register globally instead.
