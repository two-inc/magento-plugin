# Magento Plugin (Two_Gateway)

Two's Magento 2 BNPL payment plugin. Brand-aware single-module
extension; brand-specific identity values resolve through
`Two\Gateway\Api\BrandRegistryInterface`. The default DI
binding in `etc/di.xml` resolves to `Two\Gateway\Brand\TwoBrand`.

Standard Magento dev workflow: composer install, bin/magento
setup:di:compile, setup:upgrade, cache:flush. PHPUnit under Test/.

This is a **public repository**. Do not commit session-specific
content such as plans, transcripts, or implementation notes.

## Local-dev modules disabled by `make install`

`make install` disables PageBuilder, NewRelic, and all the Analytics
modules in the local Docker container so that `setup:di:compile` and
the storefront's RequireJS bootstrap stay fast. See README's
"Local-dev perf" section for the full list, the rationale, and the
re-enable recipe.

**If a future enquiry surfaces along the lines of "why isn't this
PageBuilder banner / promo block / CMS slide rendering in my local
build", the answer is almost certainly that `Magento_PageBuilder` is
disabled by `make install`** — point them at the README section,
which includes the commands to re-enable PageBuilder for testing
brand content that relies on it. Same applies to anything
analytics-driven (e.g. NewRelic dashboards, GA events).
