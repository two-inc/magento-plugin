To make the integration process as easy as possible for you, Two.inc offers an easy integration using this Magento® 2 Plugin. Before you start up the installation process, we recommend that you make a backup of your webshop files, as well as the database.

### Installation using Composer

Magento® 2 use the Composer to manage the module package and the library. Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. Composer declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.

Check if your server has composer installed by running the following command:

```bash
composer –v
```

If your server doesn’t have composer installed, you can easily install it by using this manual: https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md

Step-by-step to install the Magento® 2 extension through Composer:

1. Connect to your server running Magento® 2 using SSH or other method (make sure you have access to the command line).
2. Locate your Magento® 2 project root.
3. Install the Magento® 2 extension through composer and wait till it's completed:

    ```bash
    composer require two-inc/magento-plugin
    ```

4. Once completed run the Magento® module enable command:

    ```bash
    php bin/magento module:enable Two_Gateway
    ```

5. After that run the Magento® upgrade and clean the caches:

    ```bash
    php bin/magento setup:upgrade
    php bin/magento cache:flush
    ```

6. If Magento® is running in production mode you also need to redeploy the static content:

    ```bash
    php bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy
    ```

7. After the installation: Go to your Magento® admin portal and open ‘Stores’ > ‘Configuration’ > Sales > Payment Method > TWO
